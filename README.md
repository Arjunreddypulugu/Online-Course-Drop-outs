INTRODUCTION

The rapid growth of online education has transformed the landscape of learning, providing greater accessibility and flexibility for students worldwide. However, this shift has also brought forth a new challenge: understanding and addressing the issue of student dropout in online courses. Maintaining high retention rates is crucial for the success and sustainability of online learning programs, as student attrition can have significant implications for both educational institutions and learners.

Identifying the primary indicators of student dropout is a critical step in developing effective strategies to support online learners and improve course completion rates. By understanding the key factors that contribute to a student's decision to continue or discontinue their studies, educational institutions can tailor their interventions and create a more engaging and supportive learning environment.

In this analysis, we utilized a predictive model, specifically a LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) algorithm, to uncover the primary indicators of student dropout in online courses. By examining the feature importance from the model, we were able to gain valuable insights into the relative significance of various factors in determining whether a student continues or drops out of the course.

The findings from this analysis provide the data owner with a deeper understanding of the critical elements that influence student retention in online learning environments. By leveraging these insights, the data owner can develop targeted strategies and interventions to address the identified factors, ultimately enhancing student success and improving the overall effectiveness of the online course program.

Through a comprehensive examination of the predictive model's feature importance, this analysis aims to equip the data owner with the necessary knowledge and guidance to tackle the challenge of student dropout and foster a more engaging and supportive online learning experience for all learners. 
Project Overview

As a group, we embarked on a comprehensive data analysis project to uncover insights and develop predictive models for user attrition on a digital platform. The project was divided into several key phases: initial data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and the interpretation of results. Each phase was critical in understanding the complex dynamics of user behavior and delivering robust predictive models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We began our journey by performing a thorough exploratory data analysis to gain a deep understanding of the available data.

Data Inspection

Our first step was to examine the datasets (train.csv and log_train.csv) to understand their structure and the types of data they contained. This high-level overview provided us with valuable insights into the potential relationships between variables and the overall landscape of the data. We carefully inspected the column names, data types, and the distribution of values to get a sense of the information available to us.

Cleaning and Preprocessing

As we delved deeper, we identified and removed columns with excessive missing values, which could have skewed the model's predictions. This crucial step ensured the quality of the data and prevented biased results. We also explored techniques to handle missing values, such as imputation (Chongjason, n.d.), to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

Outlier Detection and Normalization

We then utilized visual tools like boxplots and histograms to identify and handle outliers. Outliers can have a significant impact on the performance of machine learning models, so we carefully examined the data and applied appropriate techniques to mitigate their influence. To make the data more model-friendly, we applied log transformations to normalize the data distributions (Akhtar, 2023). Normalizing the data helped to ensure that all features were on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

FEATURE ENGINEERING

Feature engineering was a pivotal part of our project, as we creatively derived new features to better capture the nuances of user interactions.





Interaction Metrics

We developed metrics such as counts of different types of events (e.g., navigate, video, problem) and access types (server vs. browser). These features aimed to provide insights into how different interaction styles correlate with user retention. By quantifying various aspects of user interactions, we could uncover patterns that might not be evident from the raw data alone. For example, we hypothesized that users who engage in a diverse range of activities might be less likely to drop out compared to those who primarily focus on a single type of interaction.

Activity Metrics

We crafted features like total_logs and unique_days to quantify user engagement over time, hypothesizing that more active users are less likely to drop out. These metrics allowed us to assess user engagement levels and their potential impact on retention. We believed that users who consistently interact with the platform and maintain a high level of activity are more likely to remain engaged and continue using the service.

DATA MERGING AND IMPUTATION:

After enhancing the datasets with our newly engineered features, we merged them into a single comprehensive dataset. This merged dataset then underwent a critical phase of imputation to handle remaining missing values.

Median Imputation

Given the skewed nature of the data, we opted for median-based imputation, which is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Using the median for imputation helped to preserve the overall distribution of the data and minimize the impact of extreme values. This approach ensured that the imputed values did not significantly distort the underlying data patterns.

Model Development and Evaluation

With the preprocessed and enriched dataset, we explored various machine learning models to predict user dropout.

Class Imbalance Handling

To address the class imbalance in the data, we implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This technique generates synthetic examples of the minority class (users who dropped out), helping to balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class (Brownlee, 2021). By addressing the class imbalance, we aimed to improve the model's fairness and predictive performance.




Model Selection and Validation

We conducted cross-validation on several models, including Logistic Regression, SVC, and XGBoost, and analyzed their performance to select the best-performing model. Cross-validation helped us assess the model's generalization ability and provided a more reliable estimate of its performance on unseen data. This approach allowed us to identify the model that would be most effective in predicting user dropout on the platform.

After calculating the mean cross-validation accuracy scores for each classifier, we created a horizontal bar graph to visualize the comparison of the classifier performance:

 

The LGBM model stood out due to its high performance. After that, we analyzed the feature importance provided by the model to understand which features were most influential in predicting user dropout. Interpreting the model's feature importances gave us valuable insights into the key drivers of user retention. This information can help the platform prioritize the most impactful factors when designing strategies to improve user engagement and reduce churn.

Business Question:

What are the primary indicators of student dropout in online courses?

We then created a pie chart and bar graph to visualizes the feature importance from the lightgbm predictive model, considering the context of predicting student dropout or continuation in an online course. This visualization aids in understanding the relative importance of various features in the model's decision-making process. 

 

 

The analysis of the predictive model's feature importance provides valuable insights into the primary indicators of student dropout in online courses. The top two features identified - Unique Days and Video - offer significant implications for understanding and addressing student attrition   in online learning environments.





Unique Days (23.4%)

The feature "Unique Days" represents the number of unique days a student interacts with the course content. This metric is the most influential predictor in the model, indicating that consistent and regular engagement is crucial for student  ttrition in online courses.

A low value for Unique Days suggests inconsistent engagement, which is a strong indicator of a student’s likelihood to drop out. This finding underscores the importance of fostering a sense of continuity and commitment in online learners. Strategies to encourage consistent participation, such as regular check-ins, progress tracking, and personalized outreach, may help mitigate the risk of student dropout.


Video (18.2%)

The second most significant feature is "Video," which represents the student's interaction with video content, such as lectures or instructional materials. This finding suggests that the level of engagement with video resources is a crucial factor in predicting student continuation or dropout in online courses.

Students who actively engage with video content are more likely to persist in the course. This highlights the importance of designing engaging and accessible video materials that cater to the learning preferences of online students. Incorporating interactive elements, providing opportunities for active learning, and ensuring the quality and relevance of video resources may contribute to improved student retention.

What does this mean to the business owner:

The results of this analysis provide valuable insights for the data owner, who is responsible for understanding and addressing student dropout in online courses. The findings suggest that the data owner should focus on the following key areas to improve student retention:

Fostering Consistent Engagement: Develop strategies to encourage students to maintain regular and consistent interaction with the course content, such as implementing progress tracking, personalized outreach, and incentives for consistent participation.
Enhancing Video Content: Invest in the development of high-quality, engaging, and interactive video resources that cater to the learning preferences of online students. This may involve incorporating multimedia elements, providing opportunities for active learning, and ensuring the relevance and accessibility of video content.
Targeted Interventions: Utilize the insights from the predictive model to identify students who are at a higher risk of dropout based on their Unique Days and Video engagement metrics. Implement targeted interventions, such as personalized outreach, additional support, or tailored learning experiences, to address the specific needs of these at-risk students.
Continuous Monitoring and Improvement: Regularly monitor and analyze student engagement and retention data to identify emerging trends and patterns. Use these insights to continuously refine and improve the online course design, content, and support systems to better meet the needs of the student population.

By addressing these key areas, the business owner can take proactive steps to enhance student retention and success in online courses, ultimately contributing to the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the online learning program.

Recommendations:

While the current analysis has provided valuable insights, there may be additional factors that could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of student dropout in online courses. For future analysis, we recommend expanding the feature set to include the following:

•	Demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location, socioeconomic status) to identify any potential patterns or correlations between student characteristics and dropout risk.
•	Academic performance metrics (e.g., assignment scores, quiz results, overall course grades) to understand the relationship between academic achievement and student retention.
•	Engagement with other course materials (e.g., discussion forums, assignments, assessments) to gain a more holistic view of student participation.
•	Contextual factors (e.g., course difficulty, instructor feedback, peer interactions) that may influence the student's decision to continue or drop out of the course.

By incorporating these additional variables, the data owner can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to student dropout, enabling the development of more targeted and effective interventions.

CONCLUSION

The analysis of the predictive model's feature importance has revealed that consistent engagement, as measured by the "Unique Days" feature, and video content interaction are the primary indicators of student dropout in online courses. By implementing strategies to foster consistent engagement, enhance video content quality and interactivity, and expand the feature set for future analysis, the data owner can take proactive steps to improve student retention and success in online learning environments.

These recommendations, if implemented effectively, can contribute to the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the online course program, ultimately benefiting both the institution and the students. By addressing the key factors identified in this analysis, the data owner can develop targeted interventions and create a more supportive and engaging online learning experience, leading to improved student outcomes and increased course completion rates.
